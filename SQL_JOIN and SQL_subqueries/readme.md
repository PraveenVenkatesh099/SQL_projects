## 💡 Purpose

This project is meant for:

- Practicing SQL joins in real-world scenarios
- Preparing for SQL-based interviews
- Understanding patterns of relational data analysis

---

## 📄 Files

- `sql_join.sql` — Contains all the queries
- `README.md` — This file, with descriptions and context

---

## 📚 Prerequisites

To run these queries, you’ll need:

- A SQL environment like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, or SQL Server
- Some mock or sample data for tables like `customers`, `orders`, `employees`, `departments`, `products`, etc.

You can generate dummy datasets using tools like [Mockaroo](https://mockaroo.com) or [DB Fiddle](https://dbfiddle.uk).

## 🤝 Contributions

Feel free to fork this repo and:

- Add new types of join examples
- Expand with sample data creation scripts
- Translate into other SQL dialects

---

## 🧠 Tips

- Use `EXPLAIN` to see how your joins are executed
- Practice writing variations using `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`, `CTEs`, and `SUBQUERIES`
